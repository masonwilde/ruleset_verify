Executable is in dist/verify_ruleset

Usage is ./verify_ruleset dataset_filename ruleset_filename [without]

use the without keyword to indicate if the rule file is without negation, leave blank for rulesets with negation

This should work cross-platform as it was created using pyinstaller, but I haven't been able to test it outside of macOS
